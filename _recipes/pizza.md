Pesto pizza is one of our family's go-to recipes for dinner. We simply swap out the red sauce for pesto as a base layer and then add toppings. Our favorite toppings for this pizza are Kalamata olives, red onion, feta and if you are an omnivore, a little chicken and Italian sausage.

Below are a couple recipes for pizza doughs we use, but you can also use a store bought one:

Make your own dough (if you have time to spare) [with this recipe.](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/all-purpose-pizza-dough-recipe
)

I need a dough 5 minutes ago recipe, give this one a shot:
1. Combine one packet of yeast with 2/3 cup water. Let sit for 5 minutes.
2. Add 2 cups flower, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp salt and mix until dough comes together.
3. Cover and rest for 15 minutes in a warm place.
4. Strech out dough on a circular pan (add a little water to your fingers to prevent sticking)
5. Add pesto, then your other toppings and bake at 375 for ~20 minutes.
