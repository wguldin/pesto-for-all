Will and I first made this recipe when we were dating as a weekend special meal.

This recipe is simple, but checks the box of satisfying, but not time consuming.

Originally, we swapped out the crème fraîche for sour cream, but if you can splurge for the crème fraîche it really does elevate this dish.
